# datastructures-python-lib
A python library for basic data structures and it's operations

NOTE: This library is a work in progress

The basic operations for the following data structures are currently implemented:
1. Stacks
2. Queues
3. Linked lists

The operations implemeted for each of these data structures are as follows
*Stacks*
- Stack push: Push an element to the top of the stack
- Stack pop: Pop the top element from the stack
- Stack peek: Peek for the top element of the stack
- Stack size: Retrieve the size of the stack
- Stack empty: Check if the stack is empty or not

*Queues*
- Queue enqueue:Push an element to the end of the queue
- Queue dequeue: Pop the first element from the queue
- Queue peek front: Peek for the first element of the queue
- Queue peek rear: Peek for the last element of the queue
- Queue size: Retrieve the size of the queue
- Queue empty: Check if the queue is empty or not

*Linked lists*
- List append node: Append node with the given data to the end of the list
- List prepend node: Prepend node with the given data to the front of the list
- List remove node: Remove node with the given data from the list
- List traverse: Read data of all the nodes in the list
